### "Implement scalar function" Commit 7e23c2dedd73b8d5b53448e75e24fe2410c19e3a
1. Refactored project structure: made a custom package called Application to contain source code, using default package is considered bad practice 
2. Implemented scalar function: returns a value between -1 and 1 to guess if the U value is going up or down
3. Added comments to __Scalar_Values_Ai.java__
